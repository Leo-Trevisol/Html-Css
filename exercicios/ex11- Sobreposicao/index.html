        <p style="color: blueviolet;">Chill out, what ya yellin' for?
            Lay back, it's all been done before
            And if, you could only let it be, you will see
            I like you the way you are
            When we're driving in your car
            And you're talking to me one on one, but you become
            Somebody else
            'Round everyone else
            You're watching your back
            Like you can't relax
            You try to be cool
            You look like a fool to me
            Tell me
            Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
            I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else
            Gets me frustrated
            Life's like this, you
            And you fall, and you crawl, and you break
            And you take what you get, and you turn it into
            Honesty and promise me I'm never gonna find you faking
            No, no, no</p>

            <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;font-size: larger;">Wait a minute
                I think I left my conscience on your front door step
                Oh, oh, wait a minute
                I think I left my consciousness in the 6th dimension
                But I'm here right now (right now), right now (right now)
                Just sitting in a cloud, oh wow
                I'm here right now (right now)
                Right now with you, oh wow, oh wow
                I don't even care
                I'll run my hands through your hair
                You wanna run your fingers through mine
                But my dreads too thick and that's alright
                Hold on, wait a minute
                Feel my heart's intention, oh
                Hold on, wait a minute
                I left my consciousness in the 6th dimension
                Left my soul in his vision
                Let's go get it, oh, oh
                Let's go get it, oh, oh</p>
