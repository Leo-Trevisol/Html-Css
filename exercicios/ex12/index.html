        <h2>Primeiro Verso</h2>
        <p>Goin' out tonight, changes into something red
            Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
            Everything she never had she's showin' off
            Drivin' too fast, moon is breakin' through her hair
            She's headin' for somethin' that she won't forget
            Havin' no regrets is all that she really wants</p>
        
        <h2>Segundo Verso</h2>
        <p>We're only gettin' older, baby
            And I've been thinkin' about it lately
            Does it ever drive you crazy
            Just how fast the night changes?
            Everything that you've ever dreamed of
            Disappearing when you wake up
            But there's nothing to be afraid of
            Even when the night changes
            It will never change me and you</p>
            <h2>Terceiro Verso</h2>
            <p>Chasing it tonight, doubts are runnin' 'round her head
                He's waitin', hides behind a cigarette
                Heart is beatin' loud and she doesn't want it to stop
                Movin' too fast, moon is lightin' up her skin
                She's fallin', doesn't even know it yet
                Havin' no regrets is all that she really wants</p>
